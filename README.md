### Summary:
This project aims to assess the risk of motorcycle accidents based on various rider characteristics. The dataset was designed with 10 features, including categorical, Gaussian continuous, discrete numerical, and boolean types. These features were used to classify the risk into three categories: low risk, medium risk, and high risk.

### Key Features:
- **Categorical Discrete:** Gender, Engine Displacement, Motorcycle Model, Pillion Rider Frequency, Helmet Type
- **Gaussian Continuous:** Male Height, Female Height, Male Weight, Female Weight, Age
- **Discrete Numerical:** Motorcycle Price, Monthly Mileage, Traffic Ticket Count, Average Speeding Rate
- **Discrete Boolean:** Driving License, Motorcycle Modification, Loud Exhaust, Mountain Riding, Regular Maintenance, Commuting with Motorcycle

### Absolutely-Right Rules:
Identified specific rules for high-risk, medium-risk, and low-risk groups based on various combinations of features.

### Classification Models:
- **Decision Tree:** Achieved an accuracy of 87.70% on the test dataset.
- **Other Models:** Implemented Naive Bayes, SVM, and KNN with accuracies ranging from 54.07% to 63.53%.
